Ideas:
- Finding communities in a graph
- A* search algorithm and comparison to Dijkstra

#Proposal

We want to implement the A\* search algorithm. We'll implement our own graph (possibly using both adj. list and matrix representations) and use the C++ heap functions to manage a priority queue. We are also planning to compare it with Dijkstra's algorithm, which would also have to be implemented. We'll evaluate it based on accuracy and time needed to find the optimal path.
